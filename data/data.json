      "content": "A fractal is a geometric pattern that exhibits self-similarity at progressively smaller scales. It occurs in nature, mathematics, and various fields of study. Fractals are produced through an iterative process where a shape is repeatedly applied to itself, creating a complex design. The most famous example of a fractal is the Mandelbrot set. Other common fractals include the Sierpinski triangle, the Julia sets, and the Koch snowflake. They are known for their intricate patterns, infinite complexity, and fractal dimension, which is always greater than their topological dimension.",
